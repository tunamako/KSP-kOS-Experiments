#KSP-kOS-Experiments

_stuco and tuna's shared automation-heavy games._

##To Do

  * set up a decent .gitignore for this repo based on the game install structure

##Getting Started

The stuff you'll need installed before you get rolling:

  * [KSP 1.1.3](https://www.skidrowreloaded.com/kerbal-space-program-v1-1-3-1289/)
    * [KOS 1.0.0](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/releases)
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

This repo should be pointed at the install directory of KSP.
It'll manage global ships, scripts, and specific game saves.

##Managed Game Saves

###Wah R&D (sandbox)
where most of the KOS testing and some subassembly building will happen.
Still setting this stuff up, but we'll get there one day.

###Wah Enterprises (career)
Where the actual srsbsns is conducted.
Ships, scripts etc. can be shared across multiple users  playing this save, but progress-based game mechanics like in-progress flights, contracts, tech tree etc. will be overwritten between commits.

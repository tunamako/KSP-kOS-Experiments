#KSP-kOS-Experiments

_stuco and tuna's shared automation-heavy games._

##To Do

  - develop proper docs for connecting to the game

##Getting Started

The stuff you'll need installed and configured before you get rolling:

  - [KSP 1.1.3](https://www.skidrowreloaded.com/kerbal-space-program-v1-1-3-1289/)
  - [CKAN](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/releases/download/v1.20.1/ckan.exe)
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Once you've got this stuff set up, open CKAN and go to our KSP game, then go `File > Install from .ckan...` and pull in `wahmods.ckan`.
(If you feel like things didn't turn out too well, just ask us.)

##Managed Game Saves

_Games documentation is a WIP since we're experimenting with using the DarkMultiPlayer mod.
Just stop by the /gen/ thread in the meantime._

#KSP-kOS-Experiments

_stuco and tuna's shared automation-heavy games._

##To Do

  - (none)

##Getting Started

The stuff you'll need installed and configured before you get rolling:

  - [KSP 1.1.3](https://www.skidrowreloaded.com/kerbal-space-program-v1-1-3-1289/)
  - [CKAN](https://github.com/ckan/ckan/wiki/How-to-Install-CKAN)
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Once you've got this stuff set up, open CKAN and go to our KSP game, then go `File > Install from .ckan...` and pull in `wahmods.ckan`.
(If you feel like things didn't turn out too well, just ask us.)

##Managed Game Saves

###Wah R&D (sandbox) (not initialized with new mods yet)
where most of the KOS testing and some subassembly building will happen.
Still setting this stuff up, but we'll get there one day.

###Wah Enterprises (career)
Where the actual srsbsns is conducted.
Ships, scripts etc. can be shared across multiple users  playing this save, but progress-based game mechanics like in-progress flights, contracts, tech tree etc. will be overwritten between commits.

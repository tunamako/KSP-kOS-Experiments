## lib_navball.

``lib_navball.ks`` provides useful routines to obtain information about
a vessel's orientation in a navbal-centric way.

### east_for

args:
  * a Vessel, such as ``SHIP``.

returns:
  * a vector.

description:
  * Returns the eastward vector of the ship's current location, to
    complete the three axes (the mod only provides SHIP:UP and
    SHIP:NORTH at the moment).

### compass_for

args:
  * a Vessel, such as ``SHIP``.

returns:
  * a number of degrees in the range [0..360)

description:
  * Returns the compass heading of the given vessel's nose.

### pitch_for

args:
  * a Vessel, such as ``SHIP``.

returns:
  * a number of degrees in the range [-90..90]

description:
  * Returns the pitch above the horizon for the vessel's nose.
    Pitching up gets a positive number, Pitching down a negative number.

### roll_for

args:
  * a Vessel, such as ``SHIP``.

returns:
  * a number of degrees in the range [-180..180]

description:
  * Returns the roll relative to the horizon for the vessel's "top".
    Left roll gets a positive number, right roll a negative number.

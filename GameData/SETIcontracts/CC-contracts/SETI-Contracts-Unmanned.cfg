	description = It is relatively easy to get into the air, or away from an object, landing and docking is much harder. While we know how to land with the help of the atmosphere, using wings, parachutes, jet engines and so on, a powered vertical landing of a non-aerodynamic vessel is something different. Thus we need to test and train for that most critical phase of a planned Mun mission here on Kerbin by landing near the black monolith north of KSC.
	synopsis = We want you to perform a remote powered landing near the black monolith north of KSC (max 40m away), after reaching 500m altitude. Naturally no parachutes, wings or even nose cones and air breathing engines (so no parachute and aero category parts) are allowed on the test lander. We recommend a very light lander (eg using landing legs, oscar fuel tanks and LV-1R engines).

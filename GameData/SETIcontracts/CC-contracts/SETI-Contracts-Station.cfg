	description = The success of our space program resulted in a wide interest in space travel from publications to university applications and courses. One of the most fascinating ideas is the vision of manned flights to other planets and the creation of permanent space colonies. Both of them provide many new challenges in terms of life support and social feasibility and are already explored by ground based research groups. We will now take it one step further and try to test our preliminary findings on board a space station!

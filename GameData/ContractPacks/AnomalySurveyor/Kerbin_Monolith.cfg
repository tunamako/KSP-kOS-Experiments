    name = AS_Kerbin_Monolith
    group = AnomalySurveyor

    sortKey = 00.03
    genericTitle = Undiscovered anomaly on Kerbin
    genericDescription = There's probably nothing else of interest to find on Kerbin, so we should start looking towards the Mun and Minmus.

    title = Investigate TMA near the KSC
    description = Linus has been complaining that his Tycho brand gyroscopes have been behaving oddly for weeks.  When Wernher finally took a look, he found some strange magnetic fields were affecting the gyroscope.  It seems to be coming from somewhere north of the KSC.  We've dubbed it the Tycho Magnetic Anomaly (TMA).  Check it out and see what's there.
    synopsis = Visit the Tycho Magnetic Anomaly.
    completedMessage = We're reading some sort of signals coming from the Monolith...  Wernher is analysing it.

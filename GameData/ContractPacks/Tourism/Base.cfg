    genericTitle = Bring tourists to a base
    genericDescription = Let's use one of our existing bases for space tourism!

    title = Bring @Tourism:touristCount.Print() @Tourism:tourists to visit @targetVessel
    description = Some @Tourism:tourists would like to visit @targetVessel on @targetBody.  This trip will cost them a lot.
    synopsis = Bring @Tourism:touristCount.Print() @Tourism:tourists to visit the base.
    completedMessage = The @Tourism:tourists had a great time!

    // Level 3 prestige
    prestige = Exceptional

    notes = Don't forget that @Tourism:tourists cannot EVA!  This means that we'll need a suitable way of getting them on the base (like a docking port).

	description = Hello, my name is Orville Kerman, and I and my brother founded Wright Aeronautical. We started out with a bicycle company but have only recently begun exploring the area of aerodynamics. We have recently developed an engine that is light enough to mount onto a flying machine!\n\nAs a member of SSI, you may purchase the following production-ready prototype part that will allow you to start making flying machines:\n\n- Small Circular Intake
	
	synopsis = Flight engine technology is at your fingertips! Simply cover the cost of our initial production run, and this prototype part will be yours! 
	
	notes = The part will be available immediately to your organization upon contract acceptance.
	
	completedMessage = Part transfer complete.\n\nYour organization now has access to the following:\n\n- Small Circular Intake\n\nEnjoy the new parts!

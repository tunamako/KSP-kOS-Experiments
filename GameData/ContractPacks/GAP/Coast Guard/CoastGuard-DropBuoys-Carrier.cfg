//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = CoastGuard-DropBuoys-Carrier
	title = Buoy Drop: 2 Navigation Buoys
	group = KSC Coast Guard
	agent = KSC Coast Guard

	description = The waters off of KSC can be treacherous in rough weather. The KSC Coast Guard has a need to deploy a few navigation buoys to help surface vessels find their way home in a storm. The buoys will contain a barometer to provide data to KSC scientists on much needed weather information so we can better inform local surface vessels of impending storms.\n\nLt. Dan Kerman wants you to take Ens. Ro Kerman to supervise the drop and afterwards collect science data from any of the deployed buoys on the surface of the water.\n\nCapt. Flip Kerman will release designs for the KSC Coast Guard Buoy subassembly we typically use for these missions if you accept this mission. These plans are dependent on you having researched a number of technologies, none of which we've checked your organization for, however, if you find you can't use the plans, you are welcome to build your own buoys with the technology you currently have access to. Unfortunately we will not be able to provide you access to government researched technology.\n\nTo avoid data collection confusion, your aircraft must not have any barometers on board, but all buoys dropped for this mission must contain a single barometer each.\n\nTo complete the mission, you probably will also need to include a transmitter on each of your buoys to collect the required science.

	synopsis = KSC Coast Guard: Our motto is Always Ready - Kemper Keratus!

	notes = You may use an airplane, helicopter, or VTOL.
	
	completedMessage = Mission Completed! Ens. Ro Kerman was very impressed with your handling of the operation. A lot of work for sure, but worth it in the long run as it will hopefully save lives.\n\nYour reputation for completing complex missions is reaching the highest levels of the Coast Guard Command. Be sure to check in at Mission Control for any new missions.

//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = SSI-Mach4
	title = Achieve Mach 4!
	group = SSI Aerospace
	agent = SSI Aerospace
	
	description = Gene Kerman wants to see if SSI Aerospace and your organization can pull off the final leg of the air speed program, and gather data for aircraft thermal effects and handling of an aircraft at high supersonic speed. What speed? Mach 4. Inigma Kerman told Gene that SSI and its partners can do it. He wants you to take up this final airspeed challenge and see if you can get an aircraft to achieve Mach 4 flying above 2,500m but below 35,000m, in level flight. If it can be done, then it opens the door to developing a spaceplane prototype in the near future.
	
	synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, fly between 2,500m and 25,000m, exceed 1372 m/s in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land and stop anywhere safely.
	
	notes = Four times the speed of sound doesn't sound...er seem that much more than three times the speed of sound. That is, unless you're a meteor, which at some point in this mission someone on the ground might mistake you for one. Good luck!
	
	completedMessage = Congratulations! You have achieved Mach 4!\n\nGene says the Kerbal Space Program and its affiliates are serious about reaching space via a spaceplane, and will look to SSI and to your organization to make it happen soon.

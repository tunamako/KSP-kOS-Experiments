//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = Wright-Bail
	title = Jump from an airplane!
	group = Wright Aeronautical
	agent = Wright Aeronautical
	
	description = SSI's safety enginer, Garnerin Kerman believes it's possible to survive jumping out of an airplane in distress using what he calls a "parachute." But he wonders why you would want to jump out of a perfectly good airplane in order to test it? He says if you really want to do this, that you will need to sign a waiver of liability lest he get the rap for an "unsuccessful test." Orville Kerman of Wright Aeronautical says "it's an idea that's never been tested... except for that one time someone jumped off a building with a bedsheet." He says he'll sport the idea for now assuming you've got a good plan to pull it off. "Needless to say," he continued, "the previous attempt with the bedsheet wasn't very successful. Poor lad."
	
	synopsis = Simply launch an airplane with a pilot and a jump volunteer, then fly above 2500m and have your volunteer jump out of the perfectly good airplane. Finally, land your airplane safely back at KSC.
	
	notes = Enjoy the freefall! It is recommended that you take Garnerin up on his idea and outfit your volunteer a parachute, else the joy of freefall could turn quite the opposite on landing. If you don't have any parachutes, Jebediah Kerman whispered something to Orville about EVA helmets being a possible landing alternative, but Orville simply gave him a hard stare and shook his head, before heading back to the hangar.
	
	completedMessage = You jumped out of an airplane and surived!\n\nIt appears your successful stunt has attracted the interest of Corliss Paraventures. Check in with Mission Control for more details.

//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = KSP-IslandLanding
	title = KSC Island Landing
	group = Kerbal Space Program
	agent = Kerbal Space Program

	description = Your survey revealed a number of trespassers were using KSC Island for illegal dumping of snack canisters. KSC Island is in desperate need of a flag which will hopefully serve as a deterrent to future violators. It's time to turn this abandoned airfield base around and bring it up to speed.\n\nYou will need to plant a flag near the old air tower for PR purposes, but before you can do this, you will need to have an upgraded Astronaut Complex with which to properly train your crews in the proper means and etiqutte in planting flags (Gene said this became a requirement after candidates started planting flags everywhere at KSC, including one that was found planted upside down in a bathroom at the VAB). A properly planted flag will serve to remind others that we're here to stay, and that we are serious about using the place for KSC operations. You may only use an airplane for this mission.

	synopsis = Land on KSC Island and plant a flag of your choice at the base of the old air tower. Take off and land back at KSC.

	notes = This requires landing on KSC Island of course. You can use a boat, but we recommend that you go ahead and try flying in. After all, it's an airfield, not a beach resort. Prove to the public that landing on the island is possible, and raise a flag on it re-claiming the island for operational use by the Kerbal Space Center. Take off and land back at KSC, and then report to Gene Kerman at Mission Control.

	completedMessage = Congratulations on landing on KSC Island and planting a flag! Your flag flutter has energized internal efforts to make KSC Island operational again. Head back to Mission Control and report to Gene Kerman for your next assignment.

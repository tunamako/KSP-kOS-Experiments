//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = Wright-BarnstormIsland
	title = Barnstorm the Island Airfield hangars!
	group = Wright Aeronautical
	agent = Wright Aeronautical
	
	description = Jebediah thinks barnstorming the Island Airfield hangars is totally possible, and looks to be far easier to do than his shed. Gene has reluctantly signed off on the idea and has cleared the Island of all air traffic until you're done with the stunt. Wright Aeronautical thinks it's another good opportunity to test your pilot's flying skills, but caution against informing the press ahead of time.
	
	synopsis = Go barnstorm one of the Island Airfield hangars. Earn a bonus reputation if you can barnstorm the second hangar too.
	
	notes = Be sure your pilot signs off on the insurance waiver before attempting this one, as it's not covered.
	
	completedMessage = You did it!\n\nGround crew personnel at the Island Airfield share the story of your successful stunt with everyone they know. Gene says if you ever get tired of doing stunts, there's more important jobs for you at Mission Control if you're interested.

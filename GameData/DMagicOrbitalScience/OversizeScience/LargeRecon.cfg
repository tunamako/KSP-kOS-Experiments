title = Big Brother Stereo Surveillance Camera
manufacturer = DMagic
description = This advanced surveillance camera features two telescopes designed to capture stereographic images while sweeping 90 degree bands of the surface. It includes four non-reusable film cannisters and has extensive on-board processing capabilities. Use this when only the best spy photos of the surface will suffice. Can be used at up to five times the normal low orbit altitude.

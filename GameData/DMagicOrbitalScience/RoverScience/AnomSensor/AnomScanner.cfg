title = Anomalous Signal Sensor
manufacturer = DMagic
description = This small sensor is designed to scan for anomalous signals across several regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. You must be within 250m of the signal to obtain science results; use it from further out to obtain an estimate of the range and distance to the signal. For the best results, return the device to the KSC for further study.

description = The ExoKerbol Core Drill (XKCD) is designed to collect subsurface core samples to search for signs of biological activity on atmospheric planets. Three drill core samples can be stored in the incubation chambers for return. Check drill animator orientation with the preview in the VAB/SPH.

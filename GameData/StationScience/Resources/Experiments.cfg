    SunInSpace = According to the kuarqs, the Sun has too little mass to support fusion and produce light of this spectra.
    MohoInSpace = The kuarqs seem to think that the planet below should be precessing. Something about "curved spacetime". What nonsense is that?
    EveInSpace = The kuarqs insist that the planet below should be superheated by a runaway greenhouse effect.
    GillyInSpace = The kuarqs question why none of the "captured asteroid" moons in this solar system orbit retrograde.
    DunaInSpace = The kuarqs are quite content here.

    DresInSpace = The kuarqs don't understand why this is called a "dwarf planet" when it has obviously cleared its neighborhood.

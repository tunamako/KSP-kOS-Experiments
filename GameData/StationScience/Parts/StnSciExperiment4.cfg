	description = Eccentric Kuarqs are quite unstable, so you'll need 2 D-ZZY Cyclotrons operating to reach the 50 you need. Once you have all 50, they'll form into a stable configuration, and your researchers in your lab can get to work. Note: don't attach directly to your station, unless you intend to return it to the surface.
